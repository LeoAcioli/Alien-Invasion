# Alien-Invasion
Alien Invasion is a Python Game where the player is a spaceship that is allowed to move in two dimensions. The aliens (enemies) 
come from the right of the screen towards the left. If an alien hits a spaceship, the alien is destroyed and the player loses one
life. There are two kinds of aliens. The basic kind is killed with one bullet, and the super alien is harder to kill. Lastly, with 
level passed, everything moves faster, which makes the game progressively harder.

#Pre-requisites
Python, a functional IDE, and install pygame. Put all files within one folder and run every single file, and lastly run alien_invasion.py.
